# Overview
Haven is a simple-to-use cookie consent manager that enables you to be GDPR and ePrivacy compliant with a few
lines of code. Haven comes with batteries included! :battery:
- Cookie notification for opt-in and opt-out strategies.
- Cookie preferences enabling users to revoke or change their consent at any time.
- Automatic injection of services (google-analytics, google-tag-manager, facebook-pixel or any custom solution) at 
runtime, after the user has given their consent.
- Translation for multiple languages and easy customization.
- Written in TS, and as such compatible with ES5, ES6+ and TS projects out of the box.
